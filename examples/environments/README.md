# Environments

Holos offers a well specified structure to manage a collection of components
consistenly across multiple environments, customers, accounts, etc...

This directory tree contains an example of managing the Bank of Holos across
dev, test, staging, and production.  The example also covers the use case of
individual developers deploying full dev copies of the stack into their own
namespaces for the purpose of development.
